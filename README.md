# Tech stack and dependencies
- This project is built with the React framework [**Next.js 13.4.7** ](https://nextjs.org/) and it's app directory.
- For styling, this project is using [**Tailwind**](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the CSS framework.  
- For persistent storage, the app uses [**Supabase** ](https://supabase.com/) for its database, file storage and authentication.
- To create and view cards, the app uses the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API on top of [**Fabric.js**](http://fabricjs.com/), a JS canvas library that allows for manipulating canvas objects _(text, images, shapes, etc)_. This library also allows for converting canvas to JSON, which is what is saved in DB.
- The project uses [**Compressor.js**](https://fengyuanchen.github.io/compressorjs/) for compressing images before uploading them to Supabase, which have a 5mb file upload size limit.
- [**React Icons**](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) and [**React Spinners**](https://www.davidhu.io/react-spinners/) for icons and spinning.  

# Local Development
